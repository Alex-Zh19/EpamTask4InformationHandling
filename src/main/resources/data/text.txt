	Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as "Nessie" (Scottish Gaelic: Niseag). 
It is connected at the southern end by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal to Loch Oich. 
At the northern end there is the Bona Narrows which opens out into Loch Dochfour, which feeds the River Ness and a further section of canal to Inverness, 
ultimately leading to the North Sea via the Moray Firth. It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; 
its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.

	At 56 km2 (22 sq mi), Loch Ness is the second-largest Scottish loch by surface area after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, 
it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. Its deepest point is 230 metres (126 fathoms; 755 feet), making it the second
deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar. A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice extending to a depth of 271 m (889 ft),
but further research determined this to be a sonar anomaly. It contains more water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, 
and is the largest body of water in the Great Glen, which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.
